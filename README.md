# Red panda pics
This is a rest api for random red pandas and (in the near future) other things. <https://redpanda.pics> for some wahs and for you devs I have <https://redpanda.pics/random> to get specific file from our cdn. Enjoy!

# Use
If you want to edit this for yourself, you will need to go through main.py and change a lot of the urls and read through some of my comments. Contact me on discord if you still want some help (Nexin ðŸŒ¸#0001)

# Updates
There is an update coming soon! This will allow for people to upload photos. I'm nearly done with it.
